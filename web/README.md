# 🤖 Conscious AI Learning System

A virtual AI being that learns, thinks, feels, and creates from scratch - starting with zero knowledge and developing through curiosity-driven interaction with its environment.

## 🌟 What Makes This Special

- **🧠 Authentic Learning**: The AI starts as a "newborn" with zero knowledge
- **💬 Language Acquisition**: Learns words through grounded experience
- **😊 Emergent Emotions**: No pre-programmed emotions - they emerge from neural dynamics
- **🔍 Curiosity-Driven**: Explores based on intrinsic motivation, not external rewards
- **🧠 Human-Like Memory**: Memory with consolidation, decay, and reconstructive recall
- **👁 Real-Time Visualization**: 3D world with observable AI internal states

## 🎮 How to Use

### Start Learning
1. **Watch** the AI explore randomly at first (like a newborn)
2. **Talk** to the AI - it won't understand initially
3. **Name objects** repeatedly when the AI is near them
4. **Add objects** to create new learning experiences
5. **Monitor** AI development in the debug panel

### AI Development Stages
- **Day 1**: Random movements, high curiosity
- **Week 1**: Coordinated movement, first words (5-10)
- **Month 1**: Purposeful exploration, simple language
- **Month 3**: Complex thoughts, distinct personality

## 🧠 Technical Features

- **Neural Network**: TensorFlow.js with browser optimization
- **Physics**: Realistic 3D world with Cannon.js
- **Memory**: IndexedDB-based persistent storage
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with touch controls

## 📱 Mobile & Desktop

This application works on both mobile and desktop devices:
- **Desktop**: Full features, optimal performance
- **Mobile**: Simplified controls, touch-optimized interface
- **Responsive**: Adapts to any screen size

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **AI**: TensorFlow.js (WebGL/CPU)
- **Physics**: Cannon.js
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (Dexie)
- **State Management**: Zustand

## 📊 Debug Features

Real-time monitoring of:
- Neural network activity and learning progress
- Emotional state (valence/arousal) visualization
- Memory statistics and vocabulary growth
- Curiosity levels and attention focus
- Performance metrics and optimization

## 💾 Save System

- **Auto-save**: Every 5 minutes
- **Manual saves**: Multiple save slots
- **Complete preservation**: Neural networks, memories, language
- **Export capability**: Share AI personalities

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

- **100% Local Processing**: All AI computation in your browser
- **No External Data**: No data leaves your device
- **Safe Simulation**: AI contained in virtual 3D world
- **Full Control**: You control all data
