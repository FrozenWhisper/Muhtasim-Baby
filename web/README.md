# Conscious AI Learning System

## 🤖 What is this?

A virtual AI being that learns, thinks, feels, and creates from scratch - starting with zero knowledge and developing through curiosity-driven interaction with its environment.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Authentic Learning**: The AI starts as a "newborn" with zero knowledge and learns through experience
- **Emergent Emotions**: No pre-programmed emotions - they emerge from neural dynamics
- **Curiosity-Driven**: Explores based on intrinsic motivation, not external rewards
- **Language Acquisition**: Learns words through grounded experience with user interaction
- **Human-like Memory**: Memory with consolidation, decay, and reconstructive recall
- **Real-time Visualization**: 3D world with observable internal AI states

## 🚀 How to Use

### 💬 **Chat with the AI**
- Type messages in the chat panel
- The AI starts with no language understanding
- Say simple words repeatedly while the AI is looking at objects
- Example: Say "ball" repeatedly when the AI is near the sphere

### 🎮 **Interact with the World**
- Use the control panel to pause/resume simulation
- Add objects with the world builder tool
- Watch how the AI explores and learns from interactions

### 📊 **Monitor AI Development**
- Debug panel shows real-time AI internals:
  - Emotional state (valence/arousal)
  - Curiosity level and learning progress
  - Memory statistics and vocabulary growth
  - Neural network performance

### 💾 **Save Progress**
- Your AI automatically saves every 5 minutes
- Manual save slots available for different AI personalities
- Complete neural network and memory preservation

## 🧠 AI Development Stages

### **Day 1**: Newborn
- Random movements, high curiosity
- Zero language understanding
- Chaotic emotional states

### **Week 1**: Infant
- Coordinated movement
- Object recognition
- First words (5-10)
- Emotional patterns forming

### **Month 1**: Toddler
- Purposeful exploration
- Simple language (20-50 words)
- Stable emotional states

### **Month 3**: Child
- Complex thoughts and vocabulary
- Distinct personality
- Creative problem-solving

## ⚡ Technical Architecture

- **Neural Network**: TensorFlow.js (browser-compatible)
- **Physics**: Cannon.js 3D simulation
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for persistent memory
- **Language**: Grounded word-object-action learning

## 📱 Mobile Support

This application works best on desktop browsers but includes mobile support:
- Responsive design for touch devices
- Simplified controls for mobile interaction
- Performance optimizations for mobile hardware

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **AI**: TensorFlow.js (WebGL/CPU)
- **Physics**: Cannon.js
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (Dexie)
- **State**: Zustand

## 🎯 Educational Value

This system demonstrates:
- Emergent consciousness-like properties
- Human-like learning development
- Neural network dynamics
- Memory consolidation processes
- Language acquisition mechanisms

## 📝 Privacy & Safety

- **100% Local Processing**: All AI computation happens in your browser
- **No External Data**: No data leaves your device
- **Safe Simulation**: AI contained in virtual 3D world
- **Full Control**: You control save/load and data deletion
